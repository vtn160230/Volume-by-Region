# Volume-by-Region

asdf

***
- Began by creating duplicates of the sheets EXT0070122021 and Sheet3 to have originals I can cross reference to later
- Renamed EXT0070122021 and sheet3 based on data in the sheet to something more appropriate and befitting (Volume Data and Geo Data)
- Unwrapped the Volume Data sheet as it looks wrapped and autofit
- Turned the data into a table and renamed the table to VolumebyClient
- Filled in the column in the CLID (Client ID) by highlighting the column with ctrl + space and Go to Special (Blanks) and referring to A2 to fill in all the blanks
- Copied the CLID column and pasted it with Values
- Went to Date Column and used the Text to Columns to delimit the data
- On the Volume column, used the Text to Columns to delimit the data
